🎯 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze how trading behavior (profitability, risk, volume) aligns or diverges from overall market sentiment. By correlating historical trade data with the Fear & Greed Index, the goal is to identify hidden trends or signals that influence smarter, sentiment-aware trading strategies in the Web3 ecosystem.

💡 Key Insights Found
Contrarian Profitability: The highest average daily PnL was recorded during Extreme Fear, indicating a successful mean-reversion or "dip-buying" strategy.

Volume Correlation: Trading volume spikes by over 600% during market panics (Extreme Fear), showing that volatility and liquidations drive the majority of trading activity.

Execution Style: There is a clear shift toward Taker orders during "Greed" phases. This suggests high FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) among participants, who prioritize immediate execution over price optimization.
